The MVC structure is a software structure that breaks code into model, view, and controller elements. The model deals primarily with the database. Here we describe the relationships between database tables to make it possible for the user or developer to manipulate data.

The view is the place where output is sent for the user to see. Generally this is where any page layouts would live. We want to do as little processing here as possible. The processing on any variables would be done else where then sent to the view for the user to interact with.

The controller is where the bulk of the applications work is done. Any kind of logic or processing of variables would be handled here. Typically the controller will receive input from the user such as a form or making an online order. The input is processed in the controller then sent to the model to update the database if necessary. The model will communicate back to the controller with a success, or failure. Which is to be communicated back to the view for the user.
The real benefit of MVC structure is the fact that software is broken into compartments. This allows for high reusability. The same logic on a controller could be applied to multiple views. Multiple views could easily pull the same data from the database. Site wide changes can be made on one controller. The database relationships are clearly defined to easily track inventory, user information, historical records, or anything that could be useful.
